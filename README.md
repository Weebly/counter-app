#Counter

Add an animated counter that counts to a number of your choosing

Want to highlight an important number on your website like a birth-date? Or the total number of countries you sell your products to? Use the Counter App to set a predetermined number and as the user scrolls by the counter the number will animated and count up to that preset number. 

The Counter App comes with several customizable design features that will allow the counter to blend in seamlessly with your website. Customize the text display options, set custom colors, and even control the speed of the counter.
